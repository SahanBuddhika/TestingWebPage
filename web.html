         <h1> Laravel Philosophy </h1>
        
        <p>Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.</p>

         <h1> Introduction </h1>
        
         <p> Laravel is a PHP based web-framework for building high-end web applications using its significant and graceful syntaxes. It comes with a strong collection of tools and provides application architecture. Moreover, it includes various characteristics of technologies like ASP.NET MVC, CodeIgniter, Ruby on Rails and lot more. This framework is open source framework. It facilitates developers by saving huge time and helps reduce the thinking and planning to develop the entire website from scratch. Along with that security of the application is also Laravel take care of. Hence all its features can boost the web development pace for you. If anyone is familiar with the basics of PHP along with some intermediate PHP scripting, then Laravel can craft your work more easily. </p>

        <h1> History </h1> 

        <p>Laravel was developed and created by Sir Taylor Otwell as an attempt for giving an excellent substitute for the older PHP framework named CodeIgniter. And this was because CodeIgniter did not offer such great features like support for built-in customer authentication and proper user authorization. On 9th of July, 2011 Laravel released its first beta version, and later in same month Laravel 1 got released. Other than authentication, Laravel also has built-in support for localization, views, dealing with sessions, routing the request to the specific controller and other amazing features.</p>
